# odin-egyptian-recipes
## what better way to review some html basics than showing off Four popular Egyptian recipes :D 

### this is the first project in the odin project , the main thing i learned in this project is the difference between the relative links and the absolute ones , correcting my path took so time since i wasn't used to the relative path method
