# odin-egyptian-recipes

## This is the first project in the odin project Foundation course , the main things i learned in this project are:
* The difference between the relative links and the absolute ones (correcting my path took some time since i wasn't used to the relative path method)
* I got better with the CLI , i can now see why it's faster to use the terminal than to use the GUI
* I got better at git and i started to learn how to write better commit msgs , i'm now using conventional commit method to the best of my ability


### What better way to review some html basics than showing off Four popular Egyptian recipes :D 
### Constructive feedback is welcome at anytime <3
